excerpt: 'This paper is about the observation of an unusual insulating state with an electrically insulating bulk that simultaneously yields bulk quantum oscillations with characteristics of an unconventional Fermi liquid in Samarium Hexaboride crystals. I worked on this research project during a summer internship at the University of Cambridge.
