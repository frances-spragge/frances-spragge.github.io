I am a DPhil student in the [Foster Lab](https://zoo-kfoster.zoo.ox.ac.uk), Department of Biochemistry (Zoology), University of Oxford. I am on the [Interdisciplinary Bioscience DTP](https://www.biodtp.ox.ac.uk) programme (2018-22), funded by the UKRI BBSRC.

Previously, I studied Biological Sciences at Somerville College, University of Oxford (2015-18), and obtained a BA (Hons).

Research interests
======

* For my DPhil I am investigating the interactions between species of commensal and pathogenic gut bacteria and how they evolve over time. I use *Salmonella enterica* serovar Typhimurium and *Klebsiella pneumoniae* as model pathogens and carry out work in vitro and in vivo.

* Project rotation in the Foster Lab studying competition and cooperation between species of commensal gut bacteria. (April to July 2019)

* Project rotation in the Griffin Lab (Department of Zoology) researching beta-lactamase secretion by *Pseudomonas aeruginosa*. (January to April 2019)

* Undergraduate research project (Department of Plant Sciences) on whether foreign pollen can inhibit pollen tube formation and reduce seed set. Involved growing and pollinating lilies, preparing and staining pistils, fluorescence microscopy and image analysis. Statistical analysis of data in R Studio.
