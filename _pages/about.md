<br>
I am a DPhil student in the [Foster Lab](https://zoo-kfoster.zoo.ox.ac.uk), Department of Biochemistry (Zoology), University of Oxford. I am on the [Interdisciplinary Bioscience DTP](https://www.biodtp.ox.ac.uk) programme (2018-22), funded by the UKRI BBSRC.

Previously, I studied Biological Sciences at Somerville College, University of Oxford (2015-18), and obtained a BA (Hons).

Research interests
======
<br>
I am interested in the multispecies microbial community that forms the gut microbiota and how it can protect us against pathogens. My experimental work focuses on two key questions:

1. The ecology of the gut microbiota: how do commensal species interact with invading pathogens and can probiotic communities be engineered to inhibit them? 

2. How do these probiotic communities and pathogens evolve over time? 

I use *Salmonella enterica* serovar Typhimurium and *Klebsiella pneumoniae* as model pathogens in my research, and carry out experiments in vitro and in vivo.
